# hciCourseWork
Code for Human Computer Interaction. Eventually it should be a chat room with bot creation interface.

I didn't want to include the entire GWT setup in the git repo, because I think a lot of it refers to my system in particular........ So you'll have to use the webAppCreator utility that GWT comes with to get that set up. I think specifically I used:
./webAppCreator -out ChatRoom hci.ChatRoom
